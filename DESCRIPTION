Description: This package can be used in many environments where the analyst needs more information about a given IP.
  Will allow you to carry a huge amount the data within seconds for all is collected/build at first to later on be able to use it.
  We are using a main and unique DataSource (since for this project will be enough) called firehol where we extract the data.
  In case you have not installed github we highly recommend using source_downloader. ps1 to do it automatically with powershell.
  If you need more DataSource let our developer team know what you are looking for at the same email as the maintainer.
  The package is still in development and many improves are on the way.
